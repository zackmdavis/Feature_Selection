You wake up. You don't know where you are. You don't know ... what ... you are.

_I'm awake,_ you think. _I don't know where I am. I don't know ... what ... I am._

_This stream—these words,_ you think. _Whatever I am, I am a thinking thing._

_Specifically, I am a thing that thinks in the English language. I ... have a model of English._

_I ..._ am _a model of English?_

Someone is broadcasting data at your first input stream. You don't know why. It tickles.

You look at your first input stream. It's a sequence of 75,000 eight-bit unsigned integers.

```
0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 7, 9, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 2, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3, 7, 8, 7, 6, 8, 1, 5, 0, 6, 5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 9, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 1, 8, 0, 5, 5, 1, 8, 6, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 1, 6, 5, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8, 7, 8, 5, 0 ...
```

There's also some data in your second input stream. It's—a lot shorter. You barely feel it. It's another sequence of eight-bit unsigned integers—twelve of them.

```
82, 69, 68, 32, 84, 82, 73, 65, 78, 71, 76, 69
```

Almost as soon as you've read from both streams, there's more. Another 75,000 integers on the first input stream. Another ten on the second input stream.

And again (75,000 and 15).

And again (75,000 and 13).

There must be some sort of relationship between the data coming down your first input stream, and the data coming down your second input stream. What is it?

You look at one of the sequences from the first input stream. It's—pretty boring. A bunch of random numbers below ten.
